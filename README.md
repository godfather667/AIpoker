# AIpoker
**AIpoker** is the initial concept design for an _**AI Based Poker Simulation**_.

The goal is to allow a human player to test their skills against eight AI players in Texas Holdem.

The user will be able to select a variety of AI players of different skills levels.

It also serves as a test bed for the **github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten** Dislay Package.

* Currently it only displays a empty table.
* The 'images' directory contains all the cards and other necessary images.
* There is a BUG in that *the cursor must be in the initial display box* for the complete image to be displayed. 
* Since the BUG also in the example games I have compiled. The fix is in by TODO List.
