# AIpoker
**AIpoker** is the initial concept design for an _**AI Based Poker Simulation**_.

The goal is to allow a human player to test their skills against eight AI players in Texas Holdem.

The user will be able to select a variety of AI players of different skills levels.

It also serves as a test bed for the **github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten** Display Package.

* Currently it displays a table with two players one where users cards both showing and one with both cards hidden.
* A sample **flop** is also displayed.
* The 'images' directory contains all the cards and other necessary images.
* There is a BUG in that *the cursor must be in the initial display box* for the complete image to be displayed. 
* This BUG is also in the example games I have compiled. The fix is on my TODO List.
